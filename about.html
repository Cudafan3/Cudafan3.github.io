				<h2 class = "bio">Mark "Styx" Sippel - Drums, Percussion, Lead Vocals, Backing Vocals</h2>
					<p class = "bio">Mark was classically trained on piano from an early age and even dabbled in learning a little Ragtime before finding his true love for percussion through Mike, a family friend. Thanks to Mike's influence (and a generous donation of his old Pearl drum set) Mark was well on his way to playing drums on and off over a span of 30 years. In order to continue with his passion for music all the while balancing all that life throws at one over the years, he acquired an electronic drum set from PINTECH (one of the early US based commercial electronic drum companies) so that he could continue to play without disturbing the neighbors (and young family). Mark also enjoys playing bass guitar from time to time. Mark has performed with several groups over the years before finally settling with a family group in Northern Kentucky called Generations.  From there he started The Charitables Band in 2020. Mark has focused his skills on playing everything from classic rock from as far back as the 50's to early metal along with a little contemporary rock, blues and country music.  The Charitables Band has allowed him to collaborate with many talented artists as well as to continue in his dedication to helping others through charitable works all the while enjoying his love of making music. When Mark isn't playing music or working a full-time job, he also loves spending time with his wife (Liz), kids, friends, and serving other charitable causes.  Mark&apos;s other interests include flying and traveling.</p>

					<h2>Mary Wheeler - Lead Vocals, Backing Vocals, Keys</h2>
					<p>Mary&apos;s love of music started at a very early age singing hymns in church before she could read. Participating in church & school choirs lead to a lifelong love of vocal music & musical theater. Classically trained at the piano beginning at the age of 8, Mary went on to perform as an accomplished accompanist for her high school show choir, regional honor choirs and received 1st place in the Kiwanis Club of Portsmouth (Ohio) Chopin Competition at the age of 17. Mary was also an accomplished band musician playing saxophone in marching, concert, and jazz/pep bands as well as competing in OMEA competitions in both saxophone and piano, receiving top ratings. Her love of music continued throughout college as she explored performing with friends on stage around the University of Cincinnati as she pursued her degree in Architecture. Her musical influences are many including classical, 80&apos;s MTV, classic rock, 90&apos;s grunge & college rock, and Broadway with favorites like the Beatles, Ella Fitzgerald, Led Zeppelin, the Eagles, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Prince, Billy Joel, Tina Turner, Blondie and Rachmaninoff to name a few. After a break from music to raise her children, Mary returned by way of the Cincinnati School of Rock through private vocal lessons and with the adult performance program. Mary&apos;s SoR show credits include Metal, 70&apos;s Rock, Lollapalooza, Americana, and Arena Rock before she “graduated” to work with The Charitables Band. When Mary isn&apos;t singing you might find her serving others as a Stephen Minister, leader of her church womens ministry, running her design and renovation business, taking care of and enjoying her family & friends, or one of her other numerous hobbies and interests.</p>
