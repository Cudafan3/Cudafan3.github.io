					<h2 class = "bio">Mark "Styx" Sippel - Drums, Percussion, Lead Vocals, Backing Vocals</h2>
					<p>Mark was classically trained on piano from an early age and even dabbled in learning a little Ragtime before finding his true love for percussion through Mike, a family friend. Thanks to Mike&apos;s influence (and a generous donation of his old Pearl drum set) Mark was well on his way to playing drums on and off over a span of 30 years. In order to continue with his passion for music all the while balancing all that life throws at one over the years, he acquired an electronic drum set from PINTECH (one of the early US based commercial electronic drum companies) so that he could continue to play without disturbing the neighbors (and young family).</p>

					<p>Mark also enjoys playing bass guitar from time to time and has performed with several groups over the years before finally settling with a family group in Northern Kentucky called Generations.  From there he started The Charitables Band in 2020. Mark has focused his skills on playing everything from classic rock from as far back as the 50&apos;s to early metal along with a little contemporary rock, blues and country music.</p>

					<p>The Charitables Band has allowed him to collaborate with many talented artists as well as to continue in his dedication to helping others through charitable works all the while enjoying his love of making music. When Mark isn&apos;t playing music or working a full-time job, he also loves spending time with his wife, kids, friends, and serving other charitable causes.  Mark&apos;s other interests include flying and traveling.</p>
